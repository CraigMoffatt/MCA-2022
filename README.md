## Week 1 Tasks

### Question 1 

The focus of my dataset will be the hit musical _Six:The Musical_ written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss. First premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2017, the musical has swept the world as a hit phenomenon. Winning multiple awards the musical tells the stories of the six wives of King Henry VIII from their perspective and is about them reclaiming their stories. The musical is a lesson in both history and girl power and is a fun, enjoyable for anyone to enjoy!

### Question 2 

Based on my own previous experiences, I do believe that many different challenges exist when collecting and working with music and music data. First of all, there is a strong chance you will find many conflicting opininos and answers to just about anything within datasets, both humans and programmes will all collect data within different ways and sometimes will come out with different answers and responses to what is given. Secondly dependent on the date of the piece you are trying to work on certain data surrounding what your looking for might not exist, for example if your piece is too modern, or too old certain details that you might be looking for might not be able to be found 

In regards to my chosen data set, I believe I will encounter both of these problems, moreso encountering the second issue. _Six: The Musical_ is a fairly new musical, only coming to London's west end in the last 5 years, so i believe that some of the data that I try to find might be a bit more difficult to come back but not impossible. However compared to musicals such as _Phantom of the Opera_ and _Funny Girl_, a lot of my data will require a lot of in depth searching 



## Week 2 Tasks

This weeks class tasked me with the task of identifying a piece of music from my dataset and downloading it as a PDF and then converting it into a musescore file, and then correcting any corrections that the converter may have had. Now as stated above my dataset is still fairly new, so I knew that I would struggle to find a free score online that was accurate to that of the actual musical. Thankfully I personally own the official book of sheet music sold on the website of the *Six:The Musical* which provides the vocal and piano sheet music for each of the queens individual songs, plus the opening track, the title track, and *Haus of Holbein*.

Now instead of downloading a million and one PDFs that may have been incorrect, I instead scanned in the first 2 pages of the sheet music for the title track *Six*, pasted the images into a word document and then converted that into a PDF. After a little messing around with the brightness of the scanned imagies, I was then able to convert this into a Musescore file.

Posted below are screenshots from the musescore file of the first 27 bars of *Six*. I chose this piece in particular as the beginning of the piece is very interesting and probably one of the most detailed out of all of the pieces within my book. It involves a tempo change at bar 11 changing from the slow lyrical opening to the upbeat pop song that the rest of the track is. It also features harmonies between the performers and gives each of the performers a couple of words to sing before coming together to create these harmonies. Finally once the tempo changes and before the individual lyrics for each of the performers start, the piano has a chance to shine, performing a complicated chord rhythm that when actually performed live is performed on the guitar as well (if not solely) and then proceeds to play a strong bass note on every beat consisting of two A flats an octave apart. To me this almost resembles a bass drum.

If you also desire, you can download my transcription of the score here!

## Week 3 Tasks 

This weeks task required me to take my score from last week, export it to both a MusicXML file and a MEI file, with taking the MEI file further into the Verovio editor.

Once completing this, I was tasked to compare three differences between MusicXML documentation and MEI documentation. 

The Results of these tasks can be found [here](https://craigmoffatt.github.io/MCA-2022/verovio.html)

## Week 4 Tasks

### Task 1 

My first task this week was to create a jSymbloic analysis of my piece, selecting a group of features for the programme to anaylse within the notated data of my piece 

The results of this task are shown below

All the data presented above comes from the feature values that I selected before instructing jSymbolic to run an analysis of my piece. I chose these features as I beleived they were the most interesting to look at, most of what I have selected require looking at the melodic features and harmonies of my piece and from trying to make sense of these I created feautes that were grouped into graphs, which are pasted below.

(Figure 4.3 - Vertical Intervals)

Figure 4.1 shows a Pitch Class Histogram of my piece. What we can understand from this is that within the analysis jSymbolic picked up that there are no sharps or flats in my piece, as the Numbers 0-11 go from C to B within the melodic scale, C=0 C sharp/D flat=1 D=2 etc. 

However, I do believe that jSymbolic has analysed this incorrectly. If you look back to the score posted in the week 2 tasks, you can see that my piece is in the key of E flat major which has 3 flats in the scale, being B, E and A - All of these notes feature in my piece according to my pitch class histogram however they have not registered as being flattened

### Task 2

The second task this week was to use python notebook to create further graphs of my piece using music21. 

![Music21 Graphy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113994036/201697241-f595eda6-8336-4745-8484-a83dfdf17732.png)

ANALYSE!!!

## Week 5

## Week 7

## Week 8

### Task 1 

This week, I was first tasked to download three tracks relating to my dataset - The three tracks I chose came from the studio cast recording album which was the first recorded versions to be released on streaming services. My tracks consist of No Way, Heart of Stone, and All You Wanna Do - The mp3 tracks were downloaded from Amazon Music 

I chose each of these songs as they each have a different sound and style to them - No Way is the track within the show that has a lot of more Spanish style and features heavily on the drumming, even giving the drummer a solo in the middle of the track, sang by Catherine of Aragon. Heart of Stone is one of the two Ballads in the show sang by Jane Seymour, it stays the same tempo throughout the entirity of the track and is the song that provides pure raw emotion in the vocals. Finally, All You Wanna Do is the very heavy pop song of the show sang by the character of Katherine Howard

To further emphasise this within the programme for the show, it states which artists that each characters style and vocals are inspired by. Catherine of Aragon is inspired by Shakira and Beyonce, Jane Seymour is inspired by, Katherine Howard is inspired by Ariana Grande and Britney Spears


After downloading these tracks, I created a table consisting of all the important technical and non-technical metadata associated with my tracks, the results of which are pasted below:

Metadata Title| Track 1| Track 2| Track 3|
